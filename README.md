# survival-analysis
The code consists of five lines, each starting with an exclamation mark !. This is because we are using the terminal or command line to install the libraries within a Jupyter notebook or Python script.

The first line installs the pandas library, which is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions to manipulate and analyze data.

The second line installs the numpy library, which is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

The third line installs the matplotlib library, which is a plotting library for Python. It provides a variety of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms.

The fourth line installs the seaborn library, which is a statistical data visualization library for Python. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics, including heatmaps, distribution plots, and regression plots.

The fifth line installs the lifelines library, which is a survival analysis library for Python. It provides functions and classes to perform survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards regression, and accelerated failure time models.

The sixth line installs the scikit-learn library, which is a machine learning library for Python. It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It also provides tools for model evaluation, selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
Loading the dataset: The load_dataset function takes a dataset name as input and returns the dataset as a pandas dataframe. The SurvLoader class from the SurvSet library is used to load the dataset.
**Preprocessing the data**: The preprocess_data function takes a dataframe as input and performs the following preprocessing steps:
Converting categorical variables to dummy variables using OneHotEncoder.
Scaling numerical variables using StandardScaler.
Handling missing values using SimpleImputer with the median as the imputation strategy.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
**Fitting the Cox proportional hazards model**: The fit_cox_model function takes the training data as input and fits a Cox proportional hazards model using the CoxPHFitter class from the lifelines library.
**Evaluating the model**: The evaluate_model function takes the fitted model, testing data, and concordance_index_censored as input and calculates the concordance index, which is a measure of the model's predictive accuracy.
**Plotting the survival curves**: The plot_survival_curves function takes the KaplanMeierFitter class from the lifelines library and a subset of the testing data as input and plots the survival curves for the subset of patients.
**Implementing the main function**: The main function calls the load_dataset, preprocess_data, fit_cox_model, evaluate_model, and plot_survival_curves functions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, fit the Cox model, evaluate the model, and plot the survival curves.
**Calling the main function**: The script calls the main function to run the survival analysis.
